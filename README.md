# Weather Dashboard
### Description
For this challenge, my goal was to create a weather site that allows the user to search a city and recieve the current conditions including tempature, wind speeds, UV index, and humidity, as well as a five day forecast for that city. Teh most recent searches are saved in local storage and can be clicked to display that city's weather information again.

## Challenges 
This project is in an unfinished state, and will be developed further. The project still needs a card for the current daily weather, as well as the ability to view and interact with saved searches.
